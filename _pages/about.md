I'm a Computer Science PhD candidate at [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/).  I am advised by Prof. [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) and Prof. [Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net).  My research primarily focuses on trustworthy language models. I've worked on adversarial robustness, privacy, and bias/fairness of NLP models. My current work studies activation steering methods for improving model reliability.
