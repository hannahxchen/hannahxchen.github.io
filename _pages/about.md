I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu), supervised by [Alex Gates](https://alexandergates.net). I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Virginia, advised by Prof. [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans) and [Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net). I'm broadly interested in topics on AI safety and ethics. My PhD research focuses on trustworthy natural language processing (NLP), addressing issues related to robustness and fairness of language models. My recent work explores representation engineering methods for mitigating bias and countering censorship.
