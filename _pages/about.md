I'm a Computer Science PhD candidate at [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/).  I am advised by Prof. [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) and Prof. [Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net).  My research primarily focuses on trustworthy NLP. I've worked on adversarial NLP and privacy attacks on NLP models in the past. I'm currently working on bias/fairness assessment for NLP models.
