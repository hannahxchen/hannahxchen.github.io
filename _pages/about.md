I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu), supervised by [Alex Gates](https://alexandergates.net). My current research studies the functional backbone of AI progress—how AI capabilities emerge, interconnect, and evolve within the broader research ecosystem, as part of UVA’s [National Security Data and Policy Institute](https://nationalsecurity.virginia.edu/). 

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Virginia, advised by Prof. [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans) and [Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net). I'm broadly interested in topics on AI safety and ethics. My PhD research focuses on trustworthy natural language processing (NLP), addressing issues related to robustness and fairness of language models. My recent work explores representation engineering methods for mitigating bias and countering censorship.
