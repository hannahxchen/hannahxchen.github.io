I'm a Computer Science PhD candidate at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), advised by Prof. [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) and Prof. [Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net). I'm broadly interested in topics on AI safety and ethics. My primary research focuses on trustworthy natural language processing (NLP), addressing issues related to robustness and fairness of language models. Currently, my work explores representation engineering methods for mitigating bias and countering censorship.
